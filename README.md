# WATCHOUT
OH NO! Kendrick Lamar is being swamped by fans after a concert!

A simple, fast-paced, and fun 2-D game written in Python.
It builds and works, but it is still a work in progress. 

Requires Python

Simply go into a terminal and enter the command:                     
```bash                     
python WATCHOUT.py                    
```
